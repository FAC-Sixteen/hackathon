## Reading List sharing platform

If you want to teach yourself about a topic, it can be very difficult. Universities help students by providing bibliographies, or reading lists. These are curated by experts in their fields and are a large part of what makes certain universities better than others. They can also be restricting - academics and universities often suggest their own work, ignoring others. The idea would essentially be a resource sharing platform, where students and academics upload copies of their university reading lists (or perhaps invent their own). This would democratise knowledge, and make curricula transparent and accessible.
