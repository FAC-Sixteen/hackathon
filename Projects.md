# Projects

## Data Visualisation project 

using data from https://www.getautopsy.com. 
They gather and analyse data from 200 failed startups and hope to provide insite.
Aim to make a dynamic and interactive visualisation of their data.(project for max 6 people)

## Reading List sharing platform

If you want to teach yourself about a topic, it can be very difficult. Universities help students by providing bibliographies, or reading lists. These are curated by experts in their fields and are a large part of what makes certain universities better than others. They can also be restricting - academics and universities often suggest their own work, ignoring others. The idea would essentially be a resource sharing platform, where students and academics upload copies of their university reading lists (or perhaps invent their own). This would democratise knowledge, and make curricula transparent and accessible.

## Banned Books In America Data Visualisation

Books are less censored than just about any other form of media. Anyone who wants to create TV, music or film has to meet certain regulatory standards; by contrast, there's no regulator restricting what you can and can't read. The only times you'll hear about book burnings are in the pages of history textbooks and dystopian novels.

Book censorship has happened before, and it may happen again, but it doesn't have any bearing on the present, right?

Wrong. In 2017, 354 books were ‘challenged’ in the US. The American Libraries Association (ALA) defines a challenge as “an attempt to remove or restrict materials from schools or libraries, based upon the objections of a person or group”.

**The Idea**
Let's create **a tool that allows concerned individuals to report book challenges**, and display the results in a **live data visualisation**.


## Travelling Salesman algorithm routing for charities

Charity volunteers drive around and collect cash buckets from corner shops etc. Could we write a live routing app to map out the best route for them to take based on a list of locations to visit. It would also be good to incorporate safety features - perhaps a check-in at each stop, an alarm button if something goes wrong etc.

## Translation live chat app widget to add on to your website

Chat bots exist in all businesses but none of them really offer the option to converse easily with a foreign customer, client or person at ease.
Ideally a solution would exist that acts as a middleman translator so that the client could speak in their natural language and it would automatically be translated (perhaps an API exists for this).
It could act like a 4 step process:
Client writes to you in their mother tongue.
Chat bot translates their text and you see their text in your language.
You write a response in your language.
Chat bot translates your reply and shows the client the version of your reply in their language instead.
This would solve a big problem in companies and startups looking to grow internationally but cant speak the language of their clients and therefore clients are forced to speak in English which can be very difficult.

## Athletes Primes Over Time

**Have top athletes primes got longer over time?**
